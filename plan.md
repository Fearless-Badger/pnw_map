# Project Requirements

Business Scenario

Assume that each team is a company. The Purdue Northwest asks companies to build a student life website including frontend and backend software.

Input data:

[a] Event Information ( Event name, abstract, event date(s), cost, locations, etc. ). For infomraiotn, see the website: https://www.pnw.edu/events/category/student-life/

[b] Customer address (city name or home address in the USA)

[c] Student name (first name, middle name, last name), Student ID. (Only when students register the event)

Output Data:

[1] Displaying the event data on the website on ascending order.

[2] Registered student information

[2] Suggested parking lots

[3] Suggested driving routes, including but not limited to, distance, toll fee, etc.

Business Logic

[1] Input event name or event date ---> register the event with students' information.

[2] Read student name and event name on database --> display events on website.

[3] Input event name or event date --> search parking lots

[4] Input city name or home address --> Call Google MAP API or openstreetmap API --> show driving map and distance
